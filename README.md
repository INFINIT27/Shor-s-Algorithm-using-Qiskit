# Shor's Algorithm using Qiskit
Implement Shor's algorithm using Qiskit and Python, designing a Quantum Circuit to generate the periodicity and calculate the prime factors.

For this project, you need to have installed a few libraries from Qiskit. Due to changes and improvements that are made to Qiskit, these steps might change depending on the version. The Qiskit version this program is developed on is Qiskit V-1.0.2.

It is highly recommended to create a virtual python environment so that the packages you will install don't collide with older or other packages that result in crashes. To do that, you can use the "venv" command and create a new directory with the new elements. One guide provided for this step can be found under "https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install"

After having the environment prepared, you need to install the following packages:

1- qiskit
2- qiskit_aer
3- qiskit-ibm-runtime
4- qiskit[visualization]
5- jupyter

To install the packages, you can use the command:
pip install <package_name>

I.E. pip install qiskit

Disclaimer!
This program will only run on your personal device, and in order to have it run in an IBM Quantum Computer, you will need to create an account on the IBM Qiskit website and establish a connection to their systems in order to run the code in a Quantum Machine.
